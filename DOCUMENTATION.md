## What is This Project?

This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** that can answer questions about a specific PDF document (in this case, a symposium document).

Think of it like a smart assistant that has read a document and can answer questions about it by:
- Finding relevant sections in the document
- Using those sections to generate accurate answers
- Showing you where the information came from

---

## What is RAG?

**RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.**

Let's break this down:

### The Problem RAG Solves

Imagine you have a large document and you want to ask questions about it. You could:
1. Give the entire document to an AI (like ChatGPT) every time you ask a question
2. But that's expensive, slow, and sometimes the document is too large!

### The RAG Solution

RAG solves this by:
1. **Breaking down** the document into smaller chunks
2. **Storing** these chunks in a special database (vector store)
3. **Finding** only the relevant chunks when you ask a question
4. **Giving** only those relevant chunks to the AI to generate an answer

**Analogy:** Think of it like a librarian who knows where every book is. Instead of reading the entire library to answer your question, they quickly find the 2-3 relevant books and use only those to help you.

betterdb-semantic-cache              # Semantic cache backed by Valkey vector search
```

### Key Terms:
- **LangChain**: A framework that makes it easier to build applications with Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **FAISS**: Facebook AI Similarity Search - a library for fast similarity search
- **FastAPI**: A modern Python web framework for building APIs
- **Streamlit**: A Python library for creating web interfaces quickly
- **BetterDB Semantic Cache**: A caching library that uses vector similarity to cache LLM responses — catches not just exact repeat questions but also paraphrases
- **Valkey**: An open-source, high-performance key-value store (Redis fork backed by AWS, Google, and Oracle). Used here as the storage backend for the semantic cache

---

## Setup and Installation

Before running the project, you need to set up your Python environment and install all required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your system
- **OpenAI API Key** (get one from [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- **Terminal/Command Prompt** access

---

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment isolates your project dependencies from other Python projects on your system.

#### For Mac/Linux:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/Symposium_Bot

# Create a virtual environment named .venv
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### For Windows:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd C:\path\to\Symposium_Bot

# Create a virtual environment named .venv
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**How to know it's activated:**
You should see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt:
```
(.venv) user@computer:~/Symposium_Bot$
```

---

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install all required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What this does:**
- Reads the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file
- Downloads and installs all listed packages
- Ensures you have the exact versions needed

**Expected output:**
```
Collecting langchain==0.3.15
  Downloading langchain-0.3.15-py3-none-any.whl
...
Successfully installed langchain-0.3.15 langchain-openai-0.2.14 ...
```

**Note:** This may take a few minutes as it downloads all dependencies.

---

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory to store your OpenAI API key:

#### For Mac/Linux:

```bash
# Create the .env file
touch .env

# Open it in a text editor (or use nano/vim)
nano .env
```

#### For Windows:

```bash
# Create the .env file using notepad
notepad .env
```

**Add the following content:**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here

# Valkey connection (semantic cache backend)
VALKEY_HOST=localhost
VALKEY_PORT=6379
```

**Important:**
- Replace `sk-your-actual-api-key-here` with your actual OpenAI API key
- `VALKEY_HOST` and `VALKEY_PORT` point to the local Valkey Docker container
- Never share or commit this file to version control
- The `.env` file should already be in `.gitignore`

---

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Check that everything is installed correctly:

```bash
# Check Python version
python --version
# Should show: Python 3.8 or higher

# Check installed packages
pip list
# Should show all packages from requirements.txt

# Verify langchain installation
python -c "import langchain; print(langchain.__version__)"
# Should output: 0.3.15
```

---

### Step 5: Prepare Your Data

Make sure you have your PDF document in the correct location:

```
Symposium_Bot/
├── data/
│   └── symposium.pdf    ← Your PDF should be here
```

If you want to use a different PDF:
1. Place it in the `data/` folder
2. Update the path in [phase1_ingestion/ingest.py](phase1_ingestion/ingest.py) (line 17)

---

### Running Commands with Virtual Environment

**IMPORTANT:** All Python commands and scripts must be run with the virtual environment activated.

#### Always Activate First:

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Running Python Scripts:

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Run Phase 1 ingestion
python phase1_ingestion/ingest.py

# Run the embedding demo
python demo_embeddings.py

# Run the backend server
python3 -m uvicorn phase2_retrieval.backend:app --reload

# Run the frontend
python3 -m streamlit run phase2_retrieval/frontend.py
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# Run Phase 1 ingestion
python phase1_ingestion/ingest.py

# Run the embedding demo
python demo_embeddings.py

# Run the backend server
python -m uvicorn phase2_retrieval.backend:app --reload

# Run the frontend
python -m streamlit run phase2_retrieval/frontend.py
```

---

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project:

```bash
deactivate
```

This returns you to your system's default Python environment.

---

### Quick Start Summary

Here's the complete workflow for starting the project:

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# 1. Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Run Phase 1 (only once)
python phase1_ingestion/ingest.py

# 3. (Optional) View embeddings demo
python demo_embeddings.py

# 4. Start backend (keep this running)
python3 -m uvicorn phase2_retrieval.backend:app --reload

# 5. In a new terminal, activate venv and start frontend
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m streamlit run phase2_retrieval/frontend.py
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# 1. Activate virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Run Phase 1 (only once)
python phase1_ingestion/ingest.py

# 3. (Optional) View embeddings demo
python demo_embeddings.py

# 4. Start backend (keep this running)
python -m uvicorn phase2_retrieval.backend:app --reload

# 5. In a new terminal/command prompt, activate venv and start frontend
.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m streamlit run phase2_retrieval/frontend.py
```

---

### Troubleshooting Setup Issues

#### Problem: "python: command not found" or "python3: command not found"

**Solution:**
- On Mac/Linux, try using `python3` instead of `python`
- On Windows, make sure Python is added to your PATH during installation

---

#### Problem: "pip: command not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Try using python -m pip instead
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

#### Problem: "Permission denied" when creating virtual environment

**Solution (Mac/Linux):**
```bash
# Use sudo for system-level permissions
sudo python3 -m venv .venv

# Or create in your home directory with proper permissions
chmod +x .venv/bin/activate
```

---

#### Problem: Virtual environment activation doesn't work

**Windows Solution:**
If you get an execution policy error:
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Then try activating again
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

#### Problem: "No module named 'dotenv'" or similar import errors

**Solution:**
Make sure virtual environment is activated and reinstall:
```bash
# Check if venv is active (should see (.venv) in prompt)
# If not, activate it first

# Reinstall requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

#### Problem: `ModuleNotFoundError` when running uvicorn or streamlit via the bare command

**Solution:**
Use `python3 -m` prefix instead of the bare command:
```bash
python3 -m uvicorn phase2_retrieval.backend:app --reload
python3 -m streamlit run phase2_retrieval/frontend.py
```
This ensures the same Python interpreter that has your installed packages is used.

---

#### Problem: Backend fails to start with `ConnectionRefusedError` or `Connection refused` to port 6379

**Cause:** The Valkey Docker container is not running.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if the container exists
docker ps -a | grep valkey-semantic-cache

# If stopped, start it
docker start valkey-semantic-cache

# If it doesn't exist, create it
docker run -d --name valkey-semantic-cache -p 6379:6379 valkey/valkey-bundle:latest
```

---

#### Problem: `FT.CREATE failed` or `Unknown command` when starting the backend

**Cause:** You're running a Valkey image that doesn't include the search module.

**Solution:** Use `valkey/valkey-bundle:latest` (not `valkey/valkey:8.x`):
```bash
docker rm -f valkey-semantic-cache
docker run -d --name valkey-semantic-cache -p 6379:6379 valkey/valkey-bundle:latest
```

---

#### Problem: Cache never hits even for identical questions

**Cause:** The `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` may be missing or wrong, causing the embedding call to fail silently.

**Solution:** Verify the key is set in `.env` and restart the backend:
```bash
grep OPENAI_API_KEY .env
python3 -m uvicorn phase2_retrieval.backend:app --reload
```

---

## Phase 1: Data Ingestion

**File:** [phase1_ingestion/ingest.py](phase1_ingestion/ingest.py)

**Purpose:** This script prepares your PDF document so the chatbot can search through it efficiently.

**When to run:** Only ONCE when you first set up the project (or when you change the PDF).

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### Step 1: Load Environment Variables (Lines 6-14)

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
```

**What it does:**
- Loads your OpenAI API key from the [.env](.env) file
- This keeps your secret key safe (never put API keys directly in code!)

**Beginner tip:** The `.env` file looks like this:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

---

#### Step 2: Load the PDF (Lines 17-26)

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

pdf_path = "data/symposium.pdf"
loader = PyPDFLoader(pdf_path)
documents = loader.load()
```

**What it does:**
- Opens the PDF file at [data/symposium.pdf](data/symposium.pdf)
- Reads all the pages
- Creates a list of "documents" (one per page)

**Example:** If your PDF has 10 pages, `documents` will be a list with 10 items.

**What's in a document?**
Each document has:
- `page_content`: The text from that page
- `metadata`: Information like page number

---

#### Step 3: Split Text into Chunks (Lines 29-42)

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000,        # Each chunk will be ~1000 characters
    chunk_overlap=200,      # 200 character overlap between chunks
    length_function=len,
)

chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
```

**Why do we need chunks?**
- AI models work better with smaller pieces of text
- It's easier to find relevant information in small chunks
- It's more cost-effective (you only process relevant chunks)

**What is `chunk_size=1000`?**
- Each piece of text will be about 1000 characters long
- That's roughly 150-200 words or 1-2 paragraphs

**What is `chunk_overlap=200`?**
- Each chunk overlaps with the next by 200 characters
- This ensures we don't split important information awkwardly

**Example:**
```
Chunk 1: "The symposium will be held on March 15th... [1000 chars]"
Chunk 2: "...March 15th at the conference center... [1000 chars]"
          ↑ (This part overlaps with Chunk 1)
```
---

#### Step 4: Create Embeddings (Lines 45-54)

```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(
    model="text-embedding-3-small"
)
```

**What are embeddings?**
Embeddings are mathematical representations of text. They convert text into a list of numbers (a vector) that captures the meaning.

**Example:**
```
Text: "The weather is sunny"
Embedding: [0.2, 0.5, -0.1, 0.8, ...]  (1536 numbers)

Text: "It's a beautiful day"
Embedding: [0.19, 0.52, -0.09, 0.79, ...]  (similar numbers!)
```

**Why embeddings?**
- Sentences with similar meanings have similar embeddings
- This allows the computer to find relevant text based on meaning, not just keywords

**The Model:** `text-embedding-3-small`
- This is OpenAI's embedding model
- "small" means it's fast and affordable
- It converts text into a vector of 1536 numbers

---

#### Step 5: Store in Vector Store (Lines 57-67)

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS

vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(
    documents=chunks,
    embedding=embeddings
)
```

**What is FAISS?**
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library that:
- Stores vectors (embeddings) efficiently
- Can quickly find similar vectors

**What happens here:**
1. Takes each chunk of text
2. Converts it to an embedding (vector)
3. Stores all embeddings in the FAISS database

**Analogy:** Think of it as creating an index in a book. Instead of reading every page to find information, you look at the index to jump to the right page.

---

#### Step 6: Save to Disk (Lines 70-79)

```python
vector_store_path = "vector_store"
vector_store.save_local(vector_store_path)
```

**What it does:**
- Saves the FAISS database to the [vector_store/](vector_store/) folder
- Creates two files:
  - `index.faiss`: The actual vector database
  - `index.pkl`: Metadata and mappings

**Why save to disk?**
- So you don't have to recreate embeddings every time (saves time and money!)
- Embeddings cost money because they call the OpenAI API

---

### Summary of Phase 1

**Input:** PDF file
**Output:** Vector database (FAISS index)

**Process:**
1. PDF → Pages
2. Pages → Chunks (smaller pieces)
3. Chunks → Embeddings (numbers representing meaning)
4. Embeddings → Stored in FAISS database
5. Database → Saved to disk

**Cost:** Each chunk requires one API call to OpenAI for embeddings. A 10-page PDF might create 50 chunks = 50 API calls.

---

### Visualizing Embeddings (Optional Demo)

**File:** [demo_embeddings.py](demo_embeddings.py)

**Purpose:** After completing Phase 1, you can run this demonstration script to visualize and understand how the embedding process works.

**When to run:** AFTER Phase 1 is complete (when vector_store folder exists).

**How to run:**
```bash
python demo_embeddings.py
```

#### What This Demo Shows

This script provides a hands-on visualization of the embedding process:

**1. Vector Store Statistics**
- Total number of chunks created from your PDF
- Dimension of each vector (1536 numbers for text-embedding-3-small)

**2. Sample Chunks and Their Embeddings**
- Shows actual text chunks from your document
- Displays the corresponding vector embeddings (arrays of numbers)
- Reveals vector statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max)

**3. Vector Similarity**
- Demonstrates how to calculate similarity between vectors
- Uses cosine similarity (ranges from -1 to 1)
- Helps understand how similar chunks are mathematically related

**4. Semantic Search Demo**
- Performs a test search query
- Shows which chunks are retrieved as most relevant
- Illustrates the retrieval process in action

#### Example Output

When you run the demo, you'll see:

```

#### Key Learning Points

**Understanding Embeddings:**
- Each chunk of text is converted into exactly 1536 numbers
- These numbers capture the semantic meaning of the text
- Similar meanings produce similar number patterns

**Vector Properties:**
- Vectors are stored as NumPy arrays of floating-point numbers
- The numbers typically range between -1 and 1
- The dimension (1536) is determined by the embedding model

**Semantic Search:**
- Your question is also converted to a vector
- FAISS compares your question vector to all chunk vectors
- The most similar vectors (chunks) are returned as results

**Why This Matters:**
This visualization helps you understand that RAG is not magic—it's mathematics! Text gets converted to numbers, and the system finds chunks with similar numbers to answer your questions.

**Customization:**
You can change the `NUM_SAMPLES` variable in the script (line 61) to see more or fewer examples.

---

## Phase 2: Backend API

**File:** [phase2_retrieval/backend.py](phase2_retrieval/backend.py)

**Purpose:** This is the "brain" of your application. It receives questions, searches the vector database, and generates answers.

**When to run:** Keep it running whenever you want to use the chatbot.

**How to run (from project root):**
```bash
python3 -m uvicorn phase2_retrieval.backend:app --reload
```

**Note:** Use `python3 -m uvicorn` (not a bare `uvicorn` command) to ensure the same Python installation that has your packages is used.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### Step 1: Setup and Imports (Lines 1-18)

```python
import os
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from pydantic import BaseModel
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings, ChatOpenAI
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
import valkey.asyncio as valkey_async
from betterdb_semantic_cache import SemanticCache, SemanticCacheOptions
from betterdb_semantic_cache.embed.openai import create_openai_embed
from betterdb_semantic_cache.types import CacheStoreOptions

load_dotenv()
```

**What's happening:**
- Imports all necessary libraries including `valkey.asyncio` (async Valkey client) and `betterdb_semantic_cache` (semantic cache library)
- `asynccontextmanager` is needed for FastAPI's lifespan pattern
- Loads environment variables (your API key and Valkey config)

---

#### Step 2: Enable CORS (Lines 18-27)

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

**What is CORS?**
CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

**Why do we need it?**
- The frontend (Streamlit) runs on port 8501
- The backend (FastAPI) runs on port 8000
- Browsers block requests between different ports for security
- CORS middleware tells the browser "it's okay, allow these requests"

**Beginner tip:** `allow_origins=["*"]` means allow requests from anywhere. In production, you'd specify exact domains.

---

#### Step 3: Load Vector Store (Lines 30-42)

```python
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")
vector_store = FAISS.load_local(
    "vector_store",
    embeddings,
    allow_dangerous_deserialization=True
)
```

**What it does:**
- Loads the FAISS database we created in Phase 1
- Initializes the same embedding model (must match the one used in Phase 1!)

**Why `allow_dangerous_deserialization=True`?**
- FAISS files use Python's pickle format
- Pickle can be dangerous if the file comes from an untrusted source
- Since we created the file ourselves, it's safe
- This parameter acknowledges that risk

**Important:** The embedding model here MUST be the same as in Phase 1!

---

#### Step 3b: Initialize Semantic Cache via Lifespan (Lines 44-67)

```python
semantic_cache: SemanticCache | None = None
_valkey_client: valkey_async.Valkey | None = None

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    global semantic_cache, _valkey_client
    _valkey_client = valkey_async.Valkey(
        host=os.getenv("VALKEY_HOST", "localhost"),
        port=int(os.getenv("VALKEY_PORT", 6379)),
    )
    semantic_cache = SemanticCache(SemanticCacheOptions(
        client=_valkey_client,
        embed_fn=create_openai_embed(model="text-embedding-3-small"),
        default_threshold=0.15,
        use_default_cost_table=True,
    ))
    await semantic_cache.initialize()
    yield
    await semantic_cache.shutdown()
    await _valkey_client.aclose()

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
```

**What is the lifespan pattern?**
FastAPI's `lifespan` context manager runs code before the server starts serving requests (`yield` marks the split point) and after it shuts down. This is the correct place to initialise resources that are async (like database connections) because the event loop is already running.

**SemanticCacheOptions explained:**
- `client` — the async Valkey connection
- `embed_fn` — function to embed questions as vectors; uses the same model as the FAISS store so distances are comparable
- `default_threshold=0.15` — cosine distance cutoff; ≤0.15 means a cache hit (questions ≥85% similar)
- `use_default_cost_table=True` — loads BetterDB's built-in pricing table for 1,900+ models so cost savings are tracked automatically

`await semantic_cache.initialize()` runs `FT.CREATE` in Valkey to create the vector index. If the index already exists it's left unchanged.

---

#### Step 4: Initialize LLM (Lines 34)

```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    temperature=0.7
)
```

**What is LLM?**
LLM stands for Large Language Model (like ChatGPT).

**What is `temperature`?**
Temperature controls how creative or focused the AI is:
- **0.0**: Very focused, deterministic (same question = same answer)
- **0.7**: Balanced (our setting)
- **1.0**: Very creative, random

**Analogy:**
- Temperature 0 = Reading from a textbook
- Temperature 0.7 = Having a conversation
- Temperature 1 = Creative writing

---

#### Step 5: Define Data Models (Lines 55-66)

```python
class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    question: str

class ChatResponse(BaseModel):
    answer: str
    sources: list
    cache_hit: bool = False
    similarity: float | None = None
```

**What are these?**
These define the structure of data sent to and from the API.

**ChatRequest:** What the frontend sends
```json
{
  "question": "What is the symposium about?"
}
```

**ChatResponse:** What the backend returns
```json
{
  "answer": "The symposium is about...",
  "sources": ["Page 1", "Page 3", "Page 5"],
  "cache_hit": false,
  "similarity": null
}
```

On a cache hit, `sources` is an empty list (we skipped the FAISS search), `cache_hit` is `true`, and `similarity` holds the computed similarity score (0.0–1.0, where 1.0 is identical).

**Why use Pydantic models?**
- Automatic validation (ensures data is correct)
- Type checking
- Automatic API documentation

---

#### Step 6: The Chat Endpoint

This is the core of the application. Let's break it down into sub-steps:

```python
@app.post("/chat", response_model=ChatResponse)
async def chat(request: ChatRequest):
```

**What is `@app.post("/chat")`?**
- This creates an API endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/chat`
- It accepts POST requests (requests that send data)
- It is now `async` because the semantic cache operations are async (Valkey I/O)

---

##### Step 6.0: Semantic Cache Check (runs before anything else)

```python
cache_result = await semantic_cache.check(request.question)

if cache_result.hit:
    similarity_score = round(1 - (cache_result.similarity or 0), 4)
    print(f"[CACHE HIT]  similarity={similarity_score:.4f}  \"{request.question}\"")
    return ChatResponse(answer=cache_result.response, sources=[], cache_hit=True, similarity=similarity_score)
```

On a cache hit, the function returns immediately — skipping FAISS search and the LLM call entirely. `cache_result.similarity` is the raw cosine *distance* (0=identical), so `1 - distance` is converted to a similarity score before returning it.

---

##### Step 6.1: Semantic Search (only runs on a cache miss)

```python
relevant_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(
    request.question,
    k=3
)

context = "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in relevant_docs])

sources = [
    f"Page {doc.metadata.get('page', 'Unknown')}"
    for doc in relevant_docs
]
```

**What is similarity search?**
1. Takes your question: "What is the date of the symposium?"
2. Converts it to an embedding (vector of numbers)
3. Finds the 3 chunks with the most similar embeddings
4. Returns those chunks

**How does it work?**
```
Question Embedding:     [0.5, 0.2, 0.8, ...]
Chunk 1 Embedding:      [0.49, 0.21, 0.79, ...]  ← Very similar!
Chunk 2 Embedding:      [0.1, 0.9, 0.3, ...]     ← Not similar
Chunk 3 Embedding:      [0.51, 0.19, 0.81, ...]  ← Very similar!
```

**What is `k=3`?**
- Return the top 3 most relevant chunks
- More chunks = more context but also more noise
- 3 is a good balance

**Building the context:**
```python
context = "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in relevant_docs])
```
This combines the 3 chunks into one big text with blank lines between them.

**Example result:**
```
Chunk 1 text goes here...

Chunk 2 text goes here...

Chunk 3 text goes here...
```

**Extracting sources:**
This creates a list like: `["Page 5", "Page 12", "Page 3"]`

---

##### Step 6.2: Build Prompt (Lines 97-113)

```python
prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", """You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context.
Use the context below to answer the question. If you cannot find the answer in the context, say so.

Context:
{context}"""),
    ("user", "{question}")
])

prompt = prompt_template.format_messages(
    context=context,
    question=request.question
)
```

**What is a prompt?**
A prompt is the instruction you give to the AI. It has two parts:

1. **System message**: Sets the AI's behavior and provides context
2. **User message**: The actual question

**Example of the final prompt:**
```
System: You are a helpful assistant...

Context:
[Text from Chunk 1]
[Text from Chunk 2]
[Text from Chunk 3]

User: What is the date of the symposium?
```

**Why include context?**
Without context, GPT-3.5 doesn't know anything about your specific document. The context gives it the information it needs to answer.

---

##### Step 6.3: Generate Response (Lines 116-121)

```python
response = llm.invoke(prompt)
answer = response.content
```

**What happens here:**
1. Sends the prompt to OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model
2. The model reads the context and question
3. Generates an answer based on the provided chunks
4. Returns the answer

**Example:**
```
Prompt: [Context about symposium] + "What is the date?"
Response: "According to the document, the symposium will be held on March 15th, 2024."
```

---

##### Step 6.4: Store in Cache and Return Response

```python
input_tokens = (response.usage_metadata or {}).get("input_tokens", 0)
output_tokens = (response.usage_metadata or {}).get("output_tokens", 0)
await semantic_cache.store(
    request.question,
    answer,
    CacheStoreOptions(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", input_tokens=input_tokens, output_tokens=output_tokens),
)

return ChatResponse(answer=answer, sources=sources, cache_hit=False)
```

**Cache store:** Saves the question embedding + answer in Valkey. Token counts from `response.usage_metadata` are passed so BetterDB can calculate the exact dollar cost saved on every future cache hit for this question.

**What it returns:**
```json
{
  "answer": "The symposium will be held on March 15th, 2024.",
  "sources": ["Page 5", "Page 12", "Page 3"],
  "cache_hit": false,
  "similarity": null
}
```

This gets sent back to the frontend.

---

#### Step 7: Health Check Endpoint (Lines 134-140)

```python
@app.get("/")
def root():
    return {"status": "Backend is running", "message": "Use /chat endpoint to ask questions"}
```

**What is this?**
A simple endpoint to check if the server is running.

**How to test:**
Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`

You'll see:
```json
{
  "status": "Backend is running",
  "message": "Use /chat endpoint to ask questions"
}
```

---

### Summary of Backend API

**Purpose:** Handle chat requests with semantic caching, falling back to RAG + LLM generation on a miss.

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /` - Health check
- `POST /chat` - Main chat endpoint (cache-aware)
- `GET /stats` - Returns cumulative cache statistics (hits, misses, hit rate, cost saved)

**Flow:**
1. Receive question
2. **Check semantic cache** — return immediately on a hit
3. (miss only) Search vector database for relevant chunks
3. Build prompt with context
4. Send to OpenAI for answer generation
5. Return answer and sources

---

## Phase 2: Frontend UI

**File:** [phase2_retrieval/frontend.py](phase2_retrieval/frontend.py)

**Purpose:** Provides a web-based chat interface for users to interact with the bot.

**When to run:** Keep it running whenever you want to use the chatbot.

**How to run:**
```bash
streamlit run phase2_retrieval/frontend.py
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### Step 1: Page Configuration (Lines 10-17)

```python
import streamlit as st

st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Symposium RAG Bot",
    page_icon="🤖",
    layout="centered"
)
```

**What is Streamlit?**
Streamlit is a Python library that makes it easy to create web interfaces without knowing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

**What does this do?**
- Sets the browser tab title to "Symposium RAG Bot"
- Sets the browser tab icon to a robot emoji
- Centers the content on the page

---

#### Step 2: Backend Configuration (Lines 20-24)

```python
BACKEND_URL = "http://localhost:8000/chat"
```

**What is this?**
The URL where the frontend will send questions.

**Breakdown:**
- `http://` - Protocol
- `localhost` - Your own computer
- `8000` - Port where the backend is running
- `/chat` - The endpoint we defined in the backend

---

#### Step 3: Initialize Chat History (Lines 27-32)

```python
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []
```

**What is `st.session_state`?**
Streamlit reruns your entire script every time something changes. `session_state` is a way to store data that persists between reruns.

**What is this doing?**
- Checks if `messages` exists in session state
- If not, creates an empty list
- This stores the entire chat history

**Example of chat history:**
```python
[
  {"role": "user", "content": "What is the symposium about?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "The symposium is about...", "sources": ["Page 1"]},
  {"role": "user", "content": "When is it?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's on March 15th.", "sources": ["Page 5"]}
]
```

---

#### Step 4: UI Header (Lines 35-41)

```python
st.title("🤖 Symposium RAG Bot")
st.markdown("Ask me anything about the symposium document!")
st.divider()
```

**What does this create?**
- A large title at the top of the page
- A subtitle with instructions
- A horizontal line to separate the header

**Visual result:**
```
🤖 Symposium RAG Bot
Ask me anything about the symposium document!
────────────────────────────────────────────
```

---

#### Step 5: Display Chat History (Lines 44-56)

```python
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        st.markdown(message["content"])

        if message["role"] == "assistant" and "sources" in message:
            with st.expander("📚 Sources"):
                for source in message["sources"]:
                    st.caption(source)
```

**What does this do?**
Loops through all previous messages and displays them.

**`st.chat_message(message["role"])`:**
- Creates a chat bubble
- `role` can be "user" or "assistant"
- Automatically adds the appropriate icon and styling

**`st.expander("📚 Sources")`:**
- Creates a collapsible section
- Starts collapsed
- User can click to expand and see sources

**Visual result:**
```
👤 User
What is the symposium about?

🤖 Assistant
The symposium is about artificial intelligence...
  📚 Sources ▼
    Page 1
    Page 5
```

---

#### Step 6: User Input Handling (Lines 59-73)

```python
if user_question := st.chat_input("Type your question here..."):

    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.markdown(user_question)

    st.session_state.messages.append({
        "role": "user",
        "content": user_question
    })
```

**What is `:=` (walrus operator)?**
It's a Python operator that assigns AND checks in one line.

This:
```python
if user_question := st.chat_input("..."):
```

Is equivalent to:
```python
user_question = st.chat_input("...")
if user_question:
```

**`st.chat_input()`:**
- Creates a text input box at the bottom of the page
- Returns `None` until the user types something and presses Enter
- Returns the user's text when they submit

**What happens when user submits:**
1. Store the question in `user_question`
2. Display it in a user chat bubble
3. Add it to chat history

---

#### Step 7: Call Backend API (Lines 76-91)

```python
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
    with st.spinner("Thinking..."):

        response = requests.post(
            BACKEND_URL,
            json={"question": user_question}
        )

        result = response.json()
        answer = result["answer"]
        sources = result.get("sources", [])
        cache_hit = result.get("cache_hit", False)
        similarity = result.get("similarity")
```

**Breaking it down:**

**`st.spinner("Thinking...")`:**
- Shows a loading animation while waiting
- Displays "Thinking..." text

**`requests.post()`:**
- Sends an HTTP POST request to the backend
- `json={"question": user_question}` sends the question as JSON

**Example request:**
```json
POST http://localhost:8000/chat
{
  "question": "What is the symposium about?"
}
```

**`response.json()`:**
- Converts the response to a Python dictionary
- Now also extracts `cache_hit` (bool) and `similarity` (float or None)

**Example response (cache miss):**
```json
{
  "answer": "The symposium is about AI...",
  "sources": ["Page 1", "Page 3"],
  "cache_hit": false,
  "similarity": null
}
```

**Example response (cache hit):**
```json
{
  "answer": "The symposium is about AI...",
  "sources": [],
  "cache_hit": true,
  "similarity": 0.9700
}
```

---

#### Step 8: Display Assistant Response

```python
st.markdown(answer)

if cache_hit and similarity is not None:
    st.caption(f"⚡ Cached  ·  similarity {similarity:.4f}")
elif sources:
    with st.expander("📚 Sources"):
        for source in sources:
            st.caption(source)
```

**What it does:**
- Displays the answer in the assistant chat bubble
- On a **cache hit**: shows a `⚡ Cached · similarity X.XXXX` caption instead of sources (no FAISS search was done)
- On a **cache miss**: shows the collapsible Sources section as before

**Visual result (cache hit):**
```
🤖 Assistant
The symposium focuses on artificial intelligence and machine learning...
⚡ Cached  ·  similarity 0.9700
```

---

#### Step 9: Save to Chat History

```python
st.session_state.messages.append({
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": answer,
    "sources": sources,
    "cache_hit": cache_hit,
    "similarity": similarity,
})
```

**What it does:**
Adds the assistant's response to chat history so it persists if the page refreshes. The `cache_hit` and `similarity` values are stored so the badge is shown correctly when the history is replayed.

---

### Summary of Frontend

**Purpose:** Provide a user-friendly chat interface

**Features:**
- Chat input box
- Chat history (persists during session)
- Loading indicator
- Source citations (on cache miss)
- `⚡ Cached` badge with similarity score (on cache hit)

**Flow:**
1. User types question
2. Display user message
3. Send request to backend
4. Show "Thinking..." spinner
5. Receive answer, `cache_hit`, and `similarity` from backend
6. Display answer with cache badge or sources depending on hit/miss
7. Save to chat history (including cache metadata)

---

---

## Phase 3: Semantic Caching with BetterDB

This phase adds a semantic caching layer between the user's question and the LLM, powered by [BetterDB](https://betterdb.com) and [Valkey](https://valkey.io).

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Every question sent to GPT-3.5-turbo costs money and takes time (~1-2 seconds). When multiple users ask similar questions — or the same user rephrases a question — the LLM is called again unnecessarily.

**Standard caching** only catches exact matches:
- "What is the event date?" → MISS (first time)
- "What is the event date?" → HIT (exact repeat)
- "When does the event take place?" → MISS (missed — different words, same meaning)

**Semantic caching** catches paraphrases too:
- "What is the event date?" → MISS (first time, stored in cache)
- "When does the event take place?" → HIT (similarity score: 0.97)

---

### Infrastructure: Valkey

Valkey is the open-source key-value store used as the storage backend for the cache. It needs the `valkey-search` module to support vector indexing (the `FT.*` commands).

**Run Valkey locally via Docker:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name valkey-semantic-cache \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  valkey/valkey-bundle:latest
```

`valkey/valkey-bundle` is the official Valkey Docker image that ships with all modules pre-loaded, including `valkey-search 1.2.0`.

**Verify vector search is available:**
```bash
docker exec -it valkey-semantic-cache valkey-cli FT._LIST
# Expected: (empty array)  — engine ready, no indexes yet
```

---

### How the Cache Works

When a question arrives at the backend:

```
User question
      │
      ▼
[1] Embed the question as a vector  (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
      │
      ▼
[2] FT.SEARCH in Valkey  — find the nearest stored question vector
      │
      ├── Cosine distance ≤ 0.15  →  CACHE HIT
      │       Return stored answer immediately. No LLM call.
      │
      └── Cosine distance > 0.15  →  CACHE MISS
              ├── FAISS search → retrieve top 3 PDF chunks
              ├── Build prompt → call GPT-3.5-turbo
              ├── Store (question embedding + answer) in Valkey
              └── Return answer
```

**Threshold explained:**
Cosine distance ranges from 0 (identical) to 1 (completely different). A threshold of `0.15` means "accept as a cache hit if the questions are at least 85% similar." This is tight enough to avoid wrong answers but loose enough to catch natural paraphrases.

---

### Changes Made to the Project

#### `.env`
Added two new variables so the Valkey host and port are configurable without touching code:
```
VALKEY_HOST=localhost
VALKEY_PORT=6379
```

#### `requirements.txt`
Added:
```
betterdb-semantic-cache
```

#### `backend.py` — Key Changes

**1. Lifespan context manager (startup/shutdown)**

The `SemanticCache` is async and must be initialised before the server starts taking requests. FastAPI's `lifespan` is the correct place for this:

```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    _valkey_client = valkey_async.Valkey(
        host=os.getenv("VALKEY_HOST", "localhost"),
        port=int(os.getenv("VALKEY_PORT", 6379)),
    )
    semantic_cache = SemanticCache(SemanticCacheOptions(
        client=_valkey_client,
        embed_fn=create_openai_embed(model="text-embedding-3-small"),
        default_threshold=0.15,
        use_default_cost_table=True,
    ))
    await semantic_cache.initialize()  # Creates the FT index in Valkey
    yield
    await semantic_cache.shutdown()
    await _valkey_client.aclose()
```

`use_default_cost_table=True` loads BetterDB's built-in pricing table (1,900+ models) so cost savings are tracked automatically — no configuration needed.

**2. Cache check at the top of `/chat`**

```python
@app.post("/chat", response_model=ChatResponse)
async def chat(request: ChatRequest):
    cache_result = await semantic_cache.check(request.question)

    if cache_result.hit:
        print(f"[CACHE HIT]  similarity={...}  \"{request.question}\"")
        return ChatResponse(answer=cache_result.response, ...)
```

On a hit, the function returns immediately — the FAISS search and LLM call are skipped entirely.

**3. Cache store after every LLM call**

```python
    await semantic_cache.store(
        request.question,
        answer,
        CacheStoreOptions(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            input_tokens=input_tokens,
            output_tokens=output_tokens,
        ),
    )
```

Token counts are extracted from the LangChain response and passed to `store()` so BetterDB can calculate the exact dollar cost saved on future hits.

**4. Terminal stats after every request**

```python
async def _print_stats() -> None:
    s = await semantic_cache.stats()
    print(
        f"[STATS] total={s.total} | hits={s.hits} | misses={s.misses} "
        f"| hit_rate={s.hit_rate:.1%} | saved=${s.cost_saved_micros / 1_000_000:.4f}"
    )
```

This gives a running view in the terminal of how the cache is performing.

**5. `/stats` endpoint**

```python
@app.get("/stats")
async def stats():
    s = await semantic_cache.stats()
    return {
        "hits": s.hits,
        "misses": s.misses,
        "total": s.total,
        "hit_rate": f"{s.hit_rate:.1%}",
        "cost_saved_usd": f"${s.cost_saved_micros / 1_000_000:.4f}",
    }
```

Accessible at `http://localhost:8000/stats`.

#### `frontend.py` — Key Changes

The `ChatResponse` model now includes `cache_hit` (bool) and `similarity` (float). The frontend uses these to display a badge on cached responses:

```python
if cache_hit:
    st.caption(f"⚡ Cached  ·  similarity {similarity:.4f}")
```

This badge appears both on the live response and when the chat history is replayed.

---

### Terminal Output Example

```
[CACHE MISS] "What is the event date?"
[STATS]      total=1 | hits=0 | misses=1 | hit_rate=0.0% | saved=$0.0000

[CACHE HIT]  similarity=0.9700  "When does the event take place?"
[STATS]      total=2 | hits=1 | misses=1 | hit_rate=50.0% | saved=$0.0008
```

---

### Troubleshooting — Semantic Cache

#### Problem: `ValkeyCommandError: FT.CREATE failed`
**Cause:** Valkey is running but the search module isn't loaded.
**Solution:** Use `valkey/valkey-bundle:latest` (not `valkey/valkey:8.x`).

#### Problem: `Connection refused` on port 6379
**Solution:** Start the Docker container:
```bash
docker start valkey-semantic-cache
```

#### Problem: Cache never hits even for identical questions
**Cause:** The `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` may be wrong, causing the embedding call to fail silently.
**Solution:** Verify the key is set and valid, then restart the backend.

## Key Concepts Explained

### 1. What are Embeddings?

**Simple explanation:**
Embeddings turn text into numbers so computers can understand meaning.

**Example:**
```
"dog"     → [0.5, 0.2, 0.9, ...]
"puppy"   → [0.52, 0.19, 0.88, ...]  ← Similar numbers!
"car"     → [0.1, 0.8, 0.3, ...]     ← Different numbers
```

**Why useful?**
The computer can calculate: "dog" and "puppy" are similar (even though the words are different).

---

### 2. What is Vector Similarity Search?

**The problem:**
You have 100 chunks of text. How do you find the most relevant ones?

**Traditional approach:**
Search for keywords. Problem: Misses synonyms and context.

**Vector approach:**
1. Convert question to embedding: `[0.5, 0.2, 0.9, ...]`
2. Compare with all chunk embeddings
3. Find chunks with most similar numbers
4. Return those chunks

**Similarity calculation:**
Uses math (cosine similarity or Euclidean distance) to measure how "close" two vectors are.

---

### 3. What is the Temperature Parameter?

Temperature controls randomness in AI responses:

| Temperature | Behavior | Example Use Case |
|------------|----------|------------------|
| 0.0 | Focused, deterministic | Math problems, factual Q&A |
| 0.3-0.7 | Balanced (default) | General chatbots |
| 0.8-1.0 | Creative, varied | Story writing, brainstorming |

**Example with temperature 0:**
- Question: "What is 2+2?"
- Always answers: "4"

**Example with temperature 1:**
- Question: "What is 2+2?"
- Might answer: "4", "Four", "Two plus two equals four", etc.

---

### 4. What is Chunking and Why Do We Need It?

**The problem:**
- Your PDF might be 100 pages
- AI models have token limits (can't process entire document at once)
- Processing entire document is expensive

**The solution:**
Break into smaller, manageable pieces (chunks).

**Good chunk size:**
- Too small (100 chars): Not enough context
- Too large (5000 chars): Too much irrelevant info
- Just right (1000 chars): ~1-2 paragraphs

**Chunk overlap:**
Prevents breaking sentences or ideas awkwardly.

---

### 5. What is the Difference Between Retrieval and Generation?

**Retrieval:**
- Finding relevant information
- Done by FAISS vector search
- Fast and cheap

**Generation:**
- Creating new text based on retrieved information
- Done by GPT-3.5-turbo
- Slower and more expensive

**Why separate?**
- Don't send entire document to GPT (expensive!)
- First retrieve only relevant parts (fast)
- Then generate answer from relevant parts (efficient)

---

### 6. What is an API?

**API = Application Programming Interface**

**Simple explanation:**
A way for programs to talk to each other.

**Our example:**
- Frontend: "Hey backend, answer this question!"
- Backend: "Sure! Here's the answer and sources."

**How they communicate:**
Using HTTP requests (like your browser does with websites).

---

### 7. Why Do We Need Both Frontend and Backend?

**Frontend (Streamlit):**
- What the user sees and interacts with
- Handles display, input, chat history
- Simple, user-friendly

**Backend (FastAPI):**
- Does the heavy work
- Vector search, AI processing
- Can be used by multiple frontends
- Can scale independently

**Analogy:**
- Frontend = Restaurant (where customers interact)
- Backend = Kitchen (where food is prepared)

---

### 8. What is CORS and Why Do We Need It?

**CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**

**The problem:**
- Frontend runs on `http://localhost:8501`
- Backend runs on `http://localhost:8000`
- Different ports = different "origins"
- Browsers block requests between different origins (security feature)

**The solution:**
Backend says "I allow requests from other origins" using CORS middleware.

---

### 9. How Does Chat History Work?

**Streamlit's behavior:**
Every time you interact with the page, Streamlit reruns the entire script.

**The problem:**
Chat history would disappear on every rerun!

**The solution:**
`st.session_state` stores data that persists between reruns.

**How it works:**
```python
# First run: Creates empty list
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []

# Add message
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "Hi"})

# Next rerun: List still exists with the message!
```

---

### 10. What is Pydantic and Why Use It?

**Pydantic:**
A library for data validation using Python type hints.

**Without Pydantic:**
```python
def chat(request):
    question = request["question"]  # Might not exist! Might be wrong type!
```

**With Pydantic:**
```python
class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    question: str

def chat(request: ChatRequest):
    question = request.question  # Guaranteed to exist and be a string!
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic validation
- Better error messages
- Type checking
- Auto-generated API docs

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Why OpenAI? Can I use other models?

**A:** Yes! You can replace OpenAI with:
- Other APIs: Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini)
- Local models: Ollama, LM Studio
- Open source: Llama, Mistral

Just replace the `ChatOpenAI` and `OpenAIEmbeddings` classes.

---

### Q: How much does this cost?

**A:** Costs depend on usage:

**One-time (Phase 1):**
- Embeddings: ~$0.01 per 100 pages

**Per question (Phase 2):**
- Embedding query: ~$0.00002
- GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.002 per question

**Example:** 1000 questions ≈ $2-3

---

### Q: Can this work with multiple PDFs?

**A:** Yes! Modify Phase 1 to loop through multiple PDFs:

```python
pdf_files = ["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf", "doc3.pdf"]
all_chunks = []

for pdf in pdf_files:
    documents = PyPDFLoader(pdf).load()
    chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    all_chunks.extend(chunks)

vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(all_chunks, embeddings)
```

---

### Q: How accurate are the answers?

**Factors affecting accuracy:**
1. **Quality of chunks:** Better chunking = better retrieval
2. **Number of retrieved chunks (k):** More chunks = more context
3. **Prompt design:** Better prompts = better answers
4. **Model choice:** GPT-4 > GPT-3.5 in accuracy

---

### Q: What if the answer isn't in the PDF?

The system prompt tells the AI:
> "If you cannot find the answer in the context, say so."

So it should respond: "I cannot find that information in the provided document."

---

### Q: Can I deploy this?

**Yes!** Common deployment options:

**Backend:**
- Railway, Render, Fly.io, AWS

**Frontend:**
- Streamlit Community Cloud (free!)
- Heroku, Vercel

**Vector Store:**
- Keep using FAISS (file-based)
- Or upgrade to: Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant (cloud vector databases)

---
